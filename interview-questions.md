# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a variable that can be inside a function that lets us apply in information inside to provide an outpout. The information that gets brought in is the argument that the parameter represents.

Researched answer: Parameters are the names of variable(s) that are within a functiion. Arguments are the value(s) that are passed in throught the use of the parameter to execute an output.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: the predefined parameters are value, index, and array. The parameter is required to have at least one or two if it is needed. The Parameters can have different names and wont affect the argument that gets applied into the function so naming the parameter differently is an option for developers to do. However if applying more than one predefined parameter, the order of which how is apllied does matter. in other words the order of how the parameter should be placed as (value, index, array). So no matter the name convention the order will be taken the same as predefined.

Researched answer: The Parameter names are technically arbituary, but the order of which it is predefined matters. The .Map() is a High Order Function that has to take at least one arguement (value) but can take 2 or 3 depending on the nesesity 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: The difference between map and filter is that although they are both High Order Functions that can create iterations and returns a new array, map creates iterations and evaluates every item into a new area with new set of values. filter creates iterations and evaluates every item if it meets a condition and out outputs a new array with a subset of the same values.

Researched answer: map will create iterations to each item in an array and return it a new array the same length as the previous.

filter will create iterations and make a evaluation for each item based on a condition and return a new array with a subset of the already given values.

4. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM (Document Object Model) is the visual representation of code. Its the general web browser view that you would normally see in a webpage.

Researched answer: Document Object Model or DOM is the interface for web documents. it represents the page so programs like javascript or react can modify the document structure, style, and content. 

5. What is React? Why would you use it?

Your answer: React is a javasript library used to develope website, mobile websites, and mobile apps. React is used to build applications in a small scale and later join them together as a whole.

Researched answer: React is a javascript library used to build user interfaces. It lets developers build compex UIs from  a small scale of peices of code and manipulate what we want to see on the screen of a web browser.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?


Your answer: hoisting is a behavior in javascript where a function or variable can be used before declareing it.

Researched answer: hoisting in javascript is a default behavior where all declerations of codes are moved toward the top of the a scope before execution.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: user story is a software feature written in persepective by the end user or customer with the purpose to describe how a project will deliver value back to the end user

2. Spread operator: Spread Operators is a addition to the javascript ES6. It is commonly used to make copies of javascript objects. it uses iterables like arrays to expand it into individual elements

3. React props: react props are properties of arguments that can be passed into react components. They are much like functions arguments in javascript and attributes in HTML

4. Conditional rendering:  a term to describe the ability render different UI markups if it meets a condition.  It allows developers to render different elements/components based on a set condition.  

5. DOM events: In HTML it allows javascript to register different event handlers within a html document.
